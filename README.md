RIT48
=====
This project was developed in less than 48 hours by Team Live Badass for RIT48, a competition where teams research, plan, design, and implement a web startup in 48 hours or less.

In recent years, people have found success by selling items for a profit on eBay. One of the biggest problems these ‘flippers’ face is the amount of time they spend searching for profitable items. Our service, MiddleMan, helps them easily find nearby items on Craigslist and compare their prices to eBay’s. This allows the user to considerably cut his time spent searching for items. Our service leverages eBay’s API and RSS feeds to automate the process of finding undervalued items. It does so by checking the price at which the item is selling on Craigslist and comparing it to average prices that similar products are being sold for on eBay. With this service, we expect to greatly increase eBay flipper profitability.
